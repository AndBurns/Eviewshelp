For simplicity, we estimate the coefficients by simple single equation OLS. Note that this approach is not strictly valid, since Y appears on the right-hand side of several of the equations as an independent variable but is endogenous to the system as a whole. Because of this, we would expect Y to be correlated with the residuals of the equations, which violates the assumptions of OLS estimation. To adjust for this, we would need to use some form of instrumental variables or system estimation (for details, see the discussion of single equation </a><span class="Link"><a href="gmmiv-Two-stage_Least_Squares.html#168132" title="Two-stage Least Squares">&#8220;Two-stage Least Squares&#8221;</a></span> and system <span class="Link"><a href="system-System_Estimation_Methods.html#63530" title="System Estimation Methods">&#8220;Two-Stage Least Squares&#8221;</a></span> and related sections beginning on <span class="Link"><a href="system-System_Estimation_Methods.html#63530" title="System Estimation Methods">(here)</a></span>).</div>

As our first exercise in assessing our model, we would like to examine the ability of our model to provide one-period ahead forecasts of our endogenous variables. To do this, we can look at the predictions of our model against our historical data, using actual values for both the exogenous and the lagged endogenous variables of the model. In EViews, we refer to this as a </a><span class="Definition">static</span> simulation.

      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="52056">We must also adjust the sample over which to solve the model, so as to avoid initializing our solution with missing values from our data. Most of our series are defined over the range of 1947Q1 to 1999Q4, but our money supply series is available only from 1959Q1. Because of this, we set the sample to 1960Q1 to 1999Q4, allowing a few extra periods prior to the sample for any lagged variables.</a></div>

      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="104452">Now that we have solved the model, we would like to look at the results. When we solved the model, the results for the endogenous variables were placed into series in the workfile with names determined by the name aliasing rules of the model. Since these series are ordinary EViews objects, we could use the workfile window to open the series and examine them directly. However, the model object provides a much more convenient way to work with the series through a view called the </a><span class="Menu_Item">Variable View</span>.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="104779">The easiest way to switch to the variable view is to select </a><span class="Menu_Item">View/Variables</span> or to click on the button labeled <span class="Menu_Item">Variables</span> on the model window button bar.</div>

      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="104797">In the variable view, each line in the window is used to represent a variable. The line contains an icon indicating the variable type (endogenous, exogenous or add factor), the name of the variable, the equation with which the variable is associated (if any), and the description field from the label of the underlying series (if available). The name of the variable may be colored according to its status, indicating whether it is being traced (blue) or whether it has been overridden (red). In our model, we can see that CN, I, R and Y are endogenous variables in the model, while G and M are exogenous.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51224">Much of the convenience of the variable view comes from the fact that it allows you to work directly with the names of the variables in the model, rather than the names of series in the workfile. This is useful because when working with a model, there are different series associated with each variable. For endogenous variables, there will be the actual historical values and one or more series of solution values. For exogenous variables, there may be several alternative scenarios for the variable. The variable view and its associated procedures help you move between these different sets of series without having to worry about the many different names involved.</a></div>

      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51924">We observe strange behavior in the results. At the beginning of the forecast period, we see a heavy dip in investment, GDP, and interest rates.

      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="104208">There is little in the paths of our exogenous variables or the history of our endogenous variables that would lead to this sharp dip, suggesting that the problem may lie with the residuals of our equations. Our investment equation is the most likely candidate, as it has a large, persistent positive residual near the end of the historical data (see figure below). This residual will be set to zero over the forecast period when solving the model, which might be the cause of the sudden drop in investment at the beginning of the forecast.</a></div>

      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51928">One way of dealing with this problem would be to change the specification of the investment equation. The simplest modification would be to add an autoregressive component to the equation, which would help reduce the persistence of the error. A better alternative would be to try to modify the variables in the equation so that the equation can provide some explanation for the sharp rise in investment during the 1990s.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="105099">An alternative approach to the problem is to leave the equation as it is, but to include an add factor in the equation so that we can model the path of the residual by hand. To include the add factor, we switch to the equation view of the model, double click on the investment equation, EQI, select the </a><span class="Menu_Item">Add factors</span> tab. Under <span class="Dialog_Item">Factor type</span>, choose <span class="Dialog_Item">Equation intercept (residual shift)</span>. A prompt will appear asking if we would like to create the add factor series (if the series I_A does not already exist in the workfile). Click on <span class="Menu_Item">OK</span> to create the series.

      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51276">Using the add factor, we can specify any path we choose for the residual of the investment equation during the forecast period. By examining the </a><span class="Menu_Item">Actual/Fitted/Residual Graph</span> view from the equation object, we see that near the end of the historical data, the residual appears to be hovering around a value of about 160. We will assume that this value holds throughout the forecast period. We can set the add factor using a few simple EViews commands:</div>
      <div class="Multi-line_Input"><a name="95279">smpl 2000q1 @last</a></div>

      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51284">Including the add factor in the model has made the results far more appealing. The sudden dip in the first period of the forecast that we saw above has been removed. The oscillations are still apparent, but are much less pronounced.</a></div>

      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="104148">So far, we have been working under the assumption that our stochastic equations hold exactly over the forecast period. In reality, we would expect to see the same sort of errors occurring in the future as we have seen in history. We have also been ignoring the fact that some of the coefficients in our equations are estimated, rather than fixed at known values. We may like to reflect this uncertainty about our coefficients in some way in the results from our model.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51286">We can incorporate these features into our EViews model using stochastic simulation.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51287">Up until now, we have thought of our model as forecasting a single point for each of our endogenous variables at each observation. As soon as we add uncertainty to the model, we should think instead of our model as predicting a whole distribution of outcomes for each variable at each observation. Our goal is to summarize these distributions using appropriate statistics.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51288">If the model is linear (as in our example) and the errors are normal, then the endogenous variables will follow a normal distribution, and the mean and standard deviation of each distribution should be sufficient to describe the distribution completely. In this case, the mean will actually be equal to the deterministic solution to the model. If the model is not linear, then the distributions of the endogenous variables need not be normal. In this case, the quantiles of the distribution may be more informative than the first two moments, since the distributions may have tails which are very different from the normal case. In a non-linear model, the mean of the distribution need not match up to the deterministic solution of the model.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51289">EViews makes it easy to calculate statistics to describe the distributions of your endogenous variables in an uncertain environment. To simulate the distributions, the model object uses a Monte Carlo approach, where the model is solved many times with pseudo-random numbers substituted for the unknown errors at each repetition. This method provides only approximate results. However, as the number of repetitions is increased, we would expect the results to approach their true values.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51290">To return to our simple macroeconomic model, we can use a stochastic simulation to provide some measure of the uncertainty in our results by adding error bounds to our predictions.

      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="94966">The error bounds in the resulting output graph show that we should be reluctant to place too much weight on the point forecasts of our model, since the bounds are quite wide on several of the variables.

      <div class="Heading_4"><a name="51296">Using Scenarios for Alternate Assumptions</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="104164">Another exercise we might like to consider when working with our model is to examine how the model behaves under alternative assumptions with respect to the exogenous variables. One approach to this would be to directly edit the exogenous series so that they contain the new values, and then resolve the model, overwriting any existing results. The problem with this approach is that it makes it awkward to manage the data and to compare the different sets of outcomes.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51297">EViews provides a better way of carrying out exercises such as this through the use of model scenarios. Using a model scenario, you can override a subset of the exogenous variables in a model to give them new values, while using the values stored in the actual series for the remainder of the variables. When you solve for a scenario, the values of the endogenous variables are assigned into workfile series with an extension specific to that scenario, making it easy to keep multiple solutions for the model within a single workfile.</a></div>

      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="104563">Alternately, after exiting the </a><span class="Menu_Item">Scenario Specification</span> dialog, you may <span class="Menu_Item">View/Variables</span> to return to the variable window of the model, click on the variable M, use the right mouse button to call up the <span class="Menu_Item">Properties</span> dialog for the variable, and then in the <span class="Menu_Item">Scenario</span> box, click on the checkbox for<span class="Menu_Item"> Use override series in scenario</span>. A message will appear asking if you would like to create the new series. Click on <span class="Dialog_Item">Yes</span> to create the series, then <span class="Menu_Item">OK</span> to return to the variable window.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="104590">In the variable window, the variable name &#8220;M&#8221; should now appear in red, indicating that it has been overridden in the active scenario. This means that the variable M will now be bound to the series M_1 instead of the series M when solving the model using &#8220;Scenario 1&#8221;. </a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="104599">(You may use the </a><span class="Menu_Item">Aliasing</span> tab to change the extension from &#8220;_1&#8221;. Note also that depending on how you created the override, you may still need to create the series M_1 in your workfile by copying the values of M.)</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="113721">For example, in our previous forecast for M, we assumed that the real money supply would be kept at a constant level during the forecast period. For our alternative scenario, we are going to assume that the real money supply is contracted sharply at the beginning of the forecast period, and held at this lower value throughout the forecast. We can set the new values using a few simple commands:</a></div>
      <div class="Multi-line_Input"><a name="51307">smpl 2000q1 2005q4</a></div>
      <div class="Multi-line_Input"><a name="51308">series m_1 = 900</a></div>
      <div class="Multi-line_Input"><a name="51309">smpl @all</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="54217">As before, we can solve the model by clicking on the </a><span class="Menu_Item">Solve</span> button. Restore the <span class="Menu_Item">Simulation type</span> to deterministic, make sure that &#8220;Scenario 1&#8221; is the active scenario, and &#8220;Baseline&#8221; is the alternate scenario, and that <span class="Menu_Item">Solve for Alternate along with Active</span> is checked. Set the solution sample to &#8220;2000 2005&#8221;. Click on <span class="Menu_Item">OK</span> to solve.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="105441">Once the solution is complete, we can use </a><span class="Menu_Item">Proc/Make Graph&#8230;</span> to display the results following the same procedure as above. First, set the <span class="Menu_Item">Model variables</span> selection to display the <span class="Menu_Item">Endogenous variables</span>. Next, set the <span class="Menu_Item">Solution series</span> list box to the setting <span class="Menu_Item">Deterministic solutions</span>, then check both the <span class="Menu_Item">Active</span> and <span class="Menu_Item">Compare</span> solution check boxes, making sure that the active scenario is set to &#8220;Scenario 1&#8221;, and the comparison scenario is set to &#8220;Baseline&#8221;. Set the sample to 1995Q1 to 2005Q4, then click on <span class="Menu_Item">OK</span>. The following graph should be displayed:</div>

      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51314">The simulation results suggest that the cut in the money supply causes a substantial increase in interest rates, which creates a small reduction in investment and a relatively minor drop in income and consumption. Overall, the predicted effects of changes in the money supply on the real economy are relatively minor in this model.</a></div>
