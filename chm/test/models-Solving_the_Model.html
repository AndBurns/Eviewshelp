      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="123070">EViews provides three methods for solving models such as these: Gauss-Seidel, E-Newton, and E-QNewton. All three are iterative procedures that attempt to reduce the change in the endogenous variables, <img class="Default EquationGraphic" src="images/models.064.09.20.jpg" width="100%" style="display: inline; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 25px; max-width: 31px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" />, <img class="Default EquationGraphic" src="images/models.064.09.21.jpg" width="100%" style="display: inline; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 25px; max-width: 50px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" />, ..., <img class="Default EquationGraphic" src="images/models.064.09.22.jpg" width="100%" style="display: inline; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 25px; max-width: 30px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" />, to zero as the model's equations are solved repeatedly. The first algorithm, Gauss-Seidel, loops through every observation in the forecast sample and at each observation solves the model while treating the past and future values as fixed. The loop is repeated until changes in the values of the endogenous variables between successive iterations become less than a specified tolerance. In essence, discrepancies between the future value of each endogenous variable and the recalculated value of that variable are diffused forwards and backwards through the observations until the discrepancies vanish, assuming the algorithm converges. Although this method is not guaranteed to converge, failure to converge is often a sign of the instability which results when the influence of the past or the future on the present does not die out as the length of time considered is increased. Such instability is often undesirable for other reasons and may indicate a poorly specified model.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="123072">This method is often referred to as the Fair-Taylor method, although the Fair-Taylor algorithm includes a particular handling of terminal conditions (the extended path method) that is slightly different from the options provided by EViews. When solving the model, EViews allows the user to specify fixed end conditions by providing values for the endogenous variables beyond the end of the forecast sample, or to determine the terminal conditions endogenously by adding extra equations for the terminal periods which impose either a constant level, a linear trend, or a constant growth rate on the endogenous variables for values beyond the end of the forecast period.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="123074">The second and third methods, E-Newton and E-QNewton (</a>Brayton, 2011), apply the well-known Newton's method and Broyden's method (respectively) to the problem of finding endogenous variable values such that <img class="Default EquationGraphic" src="images/models.064.09.23.jpg" width="100%" style="display: inline; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 22px; max-width: 63px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" />. Both algorithms repeatedly construct a linear approximation to the stacked system, use that approximation to adjust the endogenous variables, and update the approximation. These methods involve calculation of the Jacobian of <img class="Default EquationGraphic" src="images/models.064.09.24.jpg" width="100%" style="display: inline; left: 0.0pt; max-height: 22px; max-width: 26px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" />, or an approximation thereof, and are thus more computationally taxing than Gauss-Seidel. However, they have the advantage of increased robustness and applicability to a broader range of models. Small models and those with few future values are frequently solved more efficiently by E-Newton, whereas large models or those with many future values are solved more efficiently by E-QNewton.</div>

The <span class="Dialog_Item">Calc from entire sample</span> option uses the sample quantile as an estimate of the quantile of the underlying distribution. This involves storing complete tails for the observed outcomes. This can be very memory intensive since the memory used increases linearly in the number of repetitions. The <span class="Menu_Item">Reduced memory approx</span> option uses an updating algorithm due to Jain and Chlamtac (1985). This requires much less memory overall, and the amount used is independent of the number of repetitions. The updating algorithm should provide a reasonable estimate of the tails of the underlying distribution as long as the number of repetitions is not too small.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="51501">The </a><span class="Menu_Item">Interval size (2 sided)</span> box lets you select the size of the confidence interval given by the upper and lower bounds. The default size of 0.95 provides a 95% confidence interval with a weight of 2.5% in each tail. If, instead, you would like to calculate the interquartile range for the simulation results, you should input 0.5 to obtain a confidence interval with bounds at the 25% and 75% quantiles.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="99462">The </a><span class="Menu_Item">Innovation generation</span> box on the right side of the dialog determines how the innovations to stochastic equations will be generated. There are two basic methods available for generating the innovations. If <span class="Menu_Item">Method</span> is set to <span class="Menu_Item">Normal Random Numbers </span>the innovations will be generated by drawing a set of random numbers from the standard normal distribution. If <span class="Menu_Item">Method</span> is set to <span class="Menu_Item">Bootstrap</span> the innovations will be generated by drawing randomly (with replacement) from the set of actual innovations observed within a specified sample. Using bootstrapped innovations may be more appropriate than normal random numbers in cases where the equation innovations do not seem to follow a normal distribution, for example if the innovations appear asymmetric or appear to contain more outlying values than a normal distribution would suggest. Note, however, that a set of bootstrapped innovations drawn from a small sample may provide only a rough approximation to the true underlying distribution of the innovations.</div>

If no sample is provided, the bootstrap sample will be set to include the set of observations from the start of the workfile to the last observation before the start of the solution sample.

If the same observation is used for all residuals, then the covariance of the innovations in the forecast period will match the covariance of the observed innovations within the bootstrap sample.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="99511">The </a><span class="Menu_Item">Multiply bootstrap resids by</span> option can be used to rescale all bootstrapped innovations by the specified factor before applying them to the equations. This can be useful for providing a broad adjustment to the overall level of uncertainty to be applied to the model, which can be useful for trouble-shooting if the model is producing errors during stochastic simulation. Note that multiplying the innovation by the specified factor causes the variance of the innovation to increase by the square of the factor, so this option has a slightly different meaning in the bootstrap case than when using normally distributed errors.</div>

When this option is selected, coefficients are randomly redrawn at the beginning of each repetition, using the coefficient variability in the estimated equation, if possible. This technique provides a method of incorporating uncertainty surrounding the true values of the coefficients into variation in our forecast results. Note that coefficient uncertainty is ignored in nonlinear equations and in linear equations estimated with PDL terms. </div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="95585">We emphasize that the dynamic behavior of a model may be altered considerably when the coefficients in the model are varied randomly. A model which is stable may become unstable, or a model which converges exponentially may develop cyclical oscillations. One consequence is that the standard errors from a stochastic simulation of a single equation may vary from the standard errors obtained when the same equation is forecast using the EViews equation object. This result arises since the equation object uses an analytic approach to calculating standard errors based on a local linear approximation that effectively imposes stationarity on the original equation.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="95587">To specify exogenous variable uncertainty, you must provide information about the variability of each relevant exogenous variable.

Next, select the exogenous variable in question, and right mouse click, select <span class="Menu_Item">Properties...</span>, and enter the exogenous variable variance in the resulting dialog.
