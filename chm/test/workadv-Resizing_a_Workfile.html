      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="113297">Resizing a workfile page is a special case of restructuring. Simply call up the </a><span class="Menu_Item">Workfile structure</span> dialog for any workfile page by selecting <span class="Menu_Item">Proc/&#8220;Structure/Resize Current Page...&#8221;</span> from a workfile window, or by clicking on the &#8220;Range:&#8221; description header near the top of the main workfile window. EViews will open the workfile structure dialog with your current settings displayed in the appropriate fields.</div>
      <div class="Heading_4"><a name="106631">Dated - regular frequency / Unstructured</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106632">For workfile types where the structure of the data is described explicitly (dated with regular frequency, or unstructured), the </a><span class="Menu_Item">Start date</span> and <span class="Menu_Item">End date</span>, or <span class="Menu_Item">Observations</span> values will be filled out with actual values.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106633">To change the sizes of regular frequency workfiles, enter the appropriate </a><span class="Menu_Item">Start date</span> and <span class="Menu_Item">End date</span> information using explicit dates or offsets from &#8220;@FIRST&#8221; and &#8220;@LAST&#8221;.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="112296">To change the size of an unstructured workfile, change the number of </a><span class="Menu_Item">Observations</span>. Note that for unstructured data, you may only add or delete observations from the end of the workfile, you may not change the starting observation; if you wish to modify the starting observation you will need to work with an integer dated workfile.</div>
      <div class="Picture"><a name="106637"><img class="Default" src="images/workadv.014.03.1.jpg" width="100%" style="left: 0.0pt; max-height: 171px; max-width: 310px; top: 0.0pt" alt="" /></a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106638">EViews will inform you of the number of observations to be added and/or deleted, and will prompt you to continue.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106639">For example, changing the </a><span class="Menu_Item">End date</span> for your annual workfile from &#8220;2001&#8221; to &#8220;2009&#8221;, or the number of <span class="Menu_Item">Observations</span> in your unstructured workfile from &#8220;100&#8221; to &#8220;107&#8221; will both add 7 observations to the end of the respective workfiles. Likewise, changing the <span class="Menu_Item">Start date</span> of your monthly workfile from &#8220;1990:01&#8221; to &#8220;@FIRST-24&#8221; will add 24 months to the beginning of the workfile while changing the <span class="Menu_Item">End date</span> to &#8220;@LAST-3&#8221; removes (deletes) the last three observations.</div>
      <div class="Heading_4"><a name="106640">Dated - specified by date series</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106641">For a dated workfile that is structured using a date series, the dialog will open with pre-filled </a><span class="Menu_Item">Start date</span> and <span class="Menu_Item">End date</span> values containing &#8220;@FIRST&#8221; and &#8220;@LAST&#8221; as stand-ins for the earliest and latest observed dates. To change the size of a dated workfile structured by a date series, simply enter the appropriate information using explicit dates or offsets from &#8220;@FIRST&#8221; and &#8220;@LAST&#8221;.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106642">Given your start and end date values, EViews will analyze your date identifiers to determine whether you need to add or remove observations. If required, EViews will inform you of the number of observations to be added or deleted, and you will be prompted to continue. If observations are added, the date series will be modified to hold the corresponding date values. As with other forms of restructuring, deleted observations may not be recovered.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106643">An observation will be deleted if the corresponding date ID falls outside the range implied by the start and end dates. If we enter &#8220;1970&#8221; as the </a><span class="Menu_Item">Start date</span> and &#8220;2010&#8221; as the <span class="Menu_Item">End date</span> in our annual workfile, any observations whose date series value is earlier than 1970 or later than 2010 will be removed from the workfile. If we enter &#8220;@FIRST+2&#8221; and &#8220;@LAST-3&#8221; as our <span class="Menu_Item">Start date</span> and <span class="Menu_Item">End date</span>, EViews will delete the first two and last three observations from the workfile.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106644">EViews will add observations to the workfile if the </a><span class="Menu_Item">Start date</span> is earlier than &#8220;@FIRST&#8221; or the <span class="Menu_Item">End date</span> is later than &#8220;@LAST&#8221;. The observations to be added are determined by examining the regular frequency calendar to find all possible dates which fall in the desired range. If, in our annual workfile that ranges from 1980 to 2000, we specify a <span class="Menu_Item">Start date</span> of &#8220;1975&#8221;, EViews will add observations for all of the years from 1975 to 1979, and will modify the date series so that it contains the associated date values. Alternatively, entering &#8220;@FIRST&#8211;2&#8221; and &#8220;@LAST+2&#8221; adds two observations corresponding to 1978 and 1979, and two observations corresponding to 2001 and 2002.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106645">Note that there is a bit of asymmetry here in the use of offsets to &#8220;@FIRST&#8221; and &#8220;@LAST&#8221;. Offsets that remove observations from the workfile simply count from the first or last observation, while offsets that add observations to the workfile use the regular frequency calendar to determine the dates to be added.</a></div>
      <div class="Heading_4"><a name="106646">Dated Panel</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="112274">For dated panel workfiles, the prefilled </a><span class="Menu_Item">Start date</span> and <span class="Menu_Item">End date</span> values will contain &#8220;@FIRST&#8221; and &#8220;@LAST&#8221; as stand-ins for the cross-section specific earliest and latest observed dates. To resize a dated panel workfile, you may enter an explicit date value in one or both of those fields. If you elect to use offsets, you must take care to understand the inherent complexities involved.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="126942">When you enter &#8220;@FIRST+2&#8221; and &#8220;@LAST&#8211;2&#8221;, EViews trims off 2 </a><span class="Emphasis">observations</span> from the beginning and end of each cross-section. Used in this fashion, &#8220;@FIRST&#8221; refers to the earliest date for each cross-section, and the offsets are in observation space.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="126943">If we combine this trimming with balancing starts or ends, balancing occurs prior to the trimming of observations. Interestingly, this means that the starts or ends will not necessarily be balanced following trimming.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="126952">In order to use &#8220;@FIRST&#8211;2&#8221; or &#8220;@LAST+2&#8221;, EViews must balance starts or ends. The interpretation of the offsets that extend beyond the range of observations differs since they are evaluated in regular date space. If you enter &#8220;@FIRST&#8211;2&#8221; and choose to balance starts, the behavior is: first balance starts, then add two observations to the beginning in date space. Note that this operation is the same as adding two observations in regular date space to the cross-section with the earliest observed date and then balancing starts.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106650">This behavior means that you cannot easily add two observations (in date space) to the start or end of each cross-section, without possibly adding more via start or end balancing. The panel data will have balanced starts or ends following the operation.</a></div>
      <div class="Heading_4"><a name="106653">Undated with ID series / Undated Panel</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106654">Resizing an undated workfile that is structured using an ID series requires several distinct operations, since there is no simple way to describe the restructure operation. At a deep level, resizing these types of workfiles involves modifying your identifiers, and then adding or deleting observations with specific identifier values.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106655">To alter the identifier series you must first remove the workfile structure. Call up the </a><span class="Menu_Item">Workfile structure</span> dialog and select <span class="Menu_Item">Unstructured/Undated</span> from the dropdown menu. Click on <span class="Menu_Item">OK</span>. EViews will remove the existing workfile structure and will unlock the ID series.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106656">If you wish to remove observations, you should edit one of the ID series so that the desired observations have missing IDs. If you reapply the original </a><span class="Menu_Item">Undated with ID series</span> or <span class="Menu_Item">Undated Panel</span> structure, EViews will prompt you to remove observations with the missing ID values. We remind you that this step will remove all observations with missing values for the identifiers; if you originally used the missing value as a valid identifier, the corresponding observation will also be removed.</div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="106657">To add observations, you must first append observations to the workfile by expanding the unstructured workfile and then editing the ID series to add unique identifiers for the new values, or by using the built-in tools to append to the workfile page described below. Once you have added the new observations, you may reapply the workfile structure. EViews will sort your data using the identifier values, lock down the ID series, and then apply the structure to the expanded workfile.</a></div>
